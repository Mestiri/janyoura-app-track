Hi!
I'm Jihed Mestiri, a software engineer, passionated about new technologies. I'm eager to challenges because I believe that it's a good way to improve skills. It's my first year after graduation now, I have done some intership projects with JAVA JEE, Hibernate, Tomcat, MySQL. Also, I developped an Android application with which I participated in a challenge. 
So, Here is my repository! Welcome in!
